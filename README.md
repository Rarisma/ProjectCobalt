A front end written in C# that aims to make emulation easier and quicker while putting all your games in one simple, small app


# What is Project Cobalt
Project Cobalt is a front end written in C# and using the AvaloniaUI Framework which aims to unify all your Game librarys, saves and rom collections. Other features are planned however these may not be feasable and may be removed and changed at any time.

**ProjectCobalt is currently in Alpha and builds may be unstable.**


#### Compiling
Open your C# IDE of choice (Ideally Rider but VS2019 will do) and configure it to compile a standard Avalonia App.

#### FAQ
##### Why AvaloniaUI?
Originally I intended to use WinUI3 however its a bit too new and for some reason it was way slower at loading the inital database, and it just didn't work aswell as Avalonia. At some point I might look at porting it to MAUI however chances are slim due to the lack of proper linux support.

#### What APIs does ProjectCobalt access
Currently ProjectCobalt only accesses IGDB
