# What is Project Cobalt
Project Cobalt is an unnamed front end written in C# and using the WinUI3 GUI Framework (For now) which aims to unify all your game librarys, saves and rom collections. Other features are planned however these may not be feasable and may be removed and changed at any time.

**ProjectCobalt is currently in Pre-Alpha and you are not recomened to use it if you want a smooth experience.**


#### Compiling
Download Visual Studio 2019 and configure it to be able to compile WinUI3 apps (Search WinUI3 Development Setup Guide for upto date results) and compile as normal, please note that as of writing WinUI3 cannot create unpackaged apps so you will have to compile the package project and install it. At some point in the future WinUI3 will be able to create unpackaged apps.
