Hi,
These files will not run correctly unless you provide your own keys
otherwise they are functionally identical, the other file is just obfuscated
to protect my keys

If you are smart enough to deobfuscate it please tell me so I can fix it
if they get leaked ill have to make Cobalt require your own api keys
I'll also be very sad :-(

If you have a better solution (There has to be one) then either message me
or if you have the time add it yourself and open a PR
